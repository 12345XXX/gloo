    description: >
      introduces DirectResponseRoutePlugin and RedirectActionRoutePlugin plugin types.
      Similarly to how a RoutePlugin can set route-level config for a route which defines
      a routeAction, these new plugin types can set route-level config for routes which
      define directResponseActions and redirectActions, respectively.
